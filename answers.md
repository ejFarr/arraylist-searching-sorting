1. They are quite different, BinarySearch is more efficient as you are effectively searching through far less of the deck.
2. To have te same result for less effort/work BinarySearch is more efficient as you are searching through less in total.

    binary 6: does lime = blueberry, no is blueberry before lime, no 9: does pear = blueberry, no is blueberry before pear, no 11: does...
    b. search looked through 11 while binary looked through 4
    c. standard would be 1000 long while binary would be around half of that.
Sorting

2.  a. selection: 55 insertion: 10 bubble: 9
    b. selection: 55 insertion: 45 bubble: 45
    c. 10: 55, 10, 9 100: 550, 100, 90 1000: 5500, 1000, 900
3. Sorting first as you would most likely have your items earlier in the list.
